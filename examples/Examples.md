# LogSum Examples

This directory contains example outputs and configurations to help you understand what LogSum can do.

## Sample Outputs (`output/`)

These are example reports generated by LogSum in different formats:

- `sample_report.md` - Markdown report (good for documentation)
- `sample_report.json` - JSON report (for automation/scripts)  
- `sample_report.csv` - CSV report (for spreadsheet analysis)
- `sample_report.txt` - Plain text report (for terminals)
- `detailed_output.json` - Complete JSON structure with all fields

## Custom Patterns (`patterns/`)

The `patterns/` directory contains example pattern files that you can use as templates:

- `default.yaml` - Default patterns embedded in LogSum (for reference)

To use custom patterns:
```bash
# Copy and modify the example patterns
cp examples/patterns/default.yaml my-patterns.yaml
# Edit my-patterns.yaml to add your custom patterns
# Use with LogSum
logsum analyze --patterns my-patterns.yaml your-log-file.log
```

## How These Were Generated

These sample reports were created by running:

```bash
# Markdown report
logsum analyze --no-tui --output markdown testdata/sample.log > sample_report.md

# JSON report  
logsum analyze --no-tui --output json testdata/sample.log > sample_report.json

# CSV report
logsum analyze --no-tui --output csv testdata/sample.log > sample_report.csv

# Text report
logsum analyze --no-tui testdata/sample.log > sample_report.txt
```

## Try It Yourself

1. Clone this repository
2. Build LogSum: `make build`
3. Run analysis: `./logsum analyze testdata/sample.log`
4. Try different output formats with `--output json/markdown/csv`

## Using in Your Projects

These examples show you what to expect when integrating LogSum into your monitoring, CI/CD, or analysis workflows.
